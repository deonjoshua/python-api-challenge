"What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
This is the question I had to present answers for in this challenge. 

# WeatherPy
I did this by representing the relationship between weather variables (temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed) and the latitude (Northern Hemisphere/Southern Hemisphere). 
I used the citipy library to generate a list of over 500 cities and then used the OpenWeatherMap API to collect weather data for said cities. The relationships were represented using scatter plots and linear regression was used to identify correlation between the variables.

# VacationPy
I also represented the humidity levels of these cities by plotting dots on a world map. The size of the dot was representative of the humidity level. 
I then selected my ideal weather conditions for a vacation and narrowed down a few cities. Using the Geoapify API I located hotels in these cities and displayed them on a map.
